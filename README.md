# Friendliness Survey App

A super-simple Flask app using vanilla JavaScript which gives a subject a survey
that presents them with a series of pictures of people, and asks the subject
to rate the perceived friendliness of the people in the pictures. It then writes
the data to a local csv file (hence, this app is only intended to be used on a
localhost server).

**Big Disclaimer**: This app was written with functionality and efficiency of
creation prioritized (as opposed to a neat interface and well-structured code).
